**NOTE: This repository is no longer actively maintained. Please see the [DAS-N2N-torch](https://github.com/sachalapins/DAS-N2N-torch) repository for a more streamlined implementation of DAS-N2N and any model updates. These two repositories will be merged in due course.**

# DAS-N2N
Original code repository for paper "DAS-N2N: Machine learning Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) signal denoising without clean data" ([https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggad460](https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggad460)).

In this repository, we have only provided the original Tensorflow code and an accompanying notebook to reproduce the results (figures) in the paper.

We recommened using the newer implementation in the [DAS-N2N-torch](https://github.com/sachalapins/DAS-N2N-torch) repository.

If you would like further guidance on training/implementing a DAS-N2N model for your own DAS data, please feel free to get in touch: [sacha.lapins@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:sacha.lapins@bristol.ac.uk)
